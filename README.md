# Summary

This Snake replica game is based on the "[Snake Game Using Pure JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TcU2C1AACw)" instructional YouTube video by [Code Explained](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8n8ftV94ZU_DJLOLtrpORA/videos), and exclusively uses JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

### Gameplay Controls

Move the snake with the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrows beneath the Enter key. When the game is over, you have to refresh the page.

### Note

While I was building this game, I attempted to put the "script.js" file in its own folder, making it's path directory "js/script.js". However, no matter how I tried to link to this in a combination of the HTML and the JS file, the page always crashed. So, I ended up putting the JS file at the head level (like in the video), and deleting the "js" folder altogether.

### Animation

The audio and image files were provided at, and taken from, the game's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CodeExplainedRepo/Snake-JavaScript), as hosted by Code Explained.
